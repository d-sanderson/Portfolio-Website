	<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
	<p>My Personal Website will have a simple, elegant design. It will implement bootstrap to make my content mobile-friendly
		and select css styles to build out my own unique theme. My Content Strategy will be three-fold: 1) It will draw visitors
		in with a simple layout that exhibits my Front-End Dev skills. 2) It will have a Portfolio section that shows off
		my front and backend skills and 3) It will have a easy to access links that allows viewers to visit my work on other
		outlets.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		My website will consist of the following sections:

	<h2>Header/NavBar:</h2>
	<p>The Nav bar will be the same color as the Splash page so they blend together and will have links to the various
		sections of my site.</p>
	<h2>Splash:</h2>
	<p>The Splash and Navbar section will be the first thing the user sees when they land on my site so its important
		that it is easy to use and makes a good impression! I want it to be simple but thoughtfully formatted. It will have my name, title of
		"Full-Stack Web Developer" and perhaps a simple CSS drawing (that may change seasonally) and css gradient for a
		background.</p>
	<h2>About:</h2>
	<p>This section will include a brief "elevator pitch" about myself. I want it to highlight my skills and recent work
		experience (and programming languages I am most proficient in) while also giving the reader an idea of my background,
		personality and interests.
	</p>
	<h2>Portfolio:</h2>
	<p>This section will be frequently updated as I continue to add new projects to my portfolio. I want it to have a
		carousel layout with an image and description that viewers can scroll through to become familiar with my project
		experience and abilities. </p>
	<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
	<p>This portion of the site will consist of quotes from fellow deep divers and future colleagues that highlight their experience working
		with me and the skillset I brought to the table. I want this section to be a carousel that cycles through various
		testimonials.</p>
	<h2>Contact:</h2>
	<p> This section will be a fully functioning form that allows site visitors to reach me via email. My contact form
		will adhere to all the guidelines put forth by Deep Dive Instructors so that it is secure and sanitizes all user
		input.</p>
	<h2>Footer:</h2>
	<p>This will be the last piece and most simple part to code. It will be a sticky footer with a black background that
		includes
		links to my other channels such as Github, Twitter, Codepen, and LinkedIn.</p>
