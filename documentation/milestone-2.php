		<h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>
		<p>My Content Strategy for my PWP will be three-fold: 1) I will draw visitors in with a well designed layout that
			exhibits my Front-End Dev skills. 2) I will have a Portfolio that shows off my front and backend skills and 3) I
			will invite visitors to view my work on other outlets such as Github, CodePen, and Medium. </p>

		I would like to use some sort of CSS animation on the Splash Page and
