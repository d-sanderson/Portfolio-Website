## Milestone1
Great job on Milestone 1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. You did awesome job defining your target demographic and thinking out how they will be interacting with your site.

### Suggestions/Edits
I am a little annoyed you did not act on the feedback I provided you before Milestone1 was due. You were one sentence away from a TierIV. Instead, you only created the header for user-story. That was sloppy and shows poor attention to detail, which is essential in programming.

*  Go ahead and delete the `/style.css` file. Not only is the file empty but any CSS written for Milestone1 or Milestone2a should be isolated in the `/public_html/documentation` directory.
* you have dumb errors in your HTML [W3CValidator-Report](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&showoutline=yes&showimagereport=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~dsanderson3%2FPWP%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php)
 * Going forward the type of errors highlighted by the W3validator Report will impact your grade in the class. 
 ### Grade Tier III
